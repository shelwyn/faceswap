## üß† About the Model

### inswapper_128.onnx

This is the core face swapping model file from InsightFace. The model:

- Is based on deep learning architecture optimized for face swapping
- Provides high-quality face replacement while preserving facial expressions
- Works with the ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) format for cross-platform compatibility
- Has been trained on extensive facial datasets to ensure realistic results
- Maintains facial attributes like lighting, angle, and expression from the target image

The model automatically downloads on first run if not present. It's approximately 530MB in size.

## üîß Dependencies

- **streamlit**: Web application framework
- **opencv-python-headless**: Computer vision operations
- **insightface**: Face analysis and swapping library
- **onnxruntime**: ONNX model inference
- **Pillow**: Image processing
- **numpy**: Numerical computations

## üìã Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Windows/macOS/Linux
- Webcam (optional, for camera capture)
- Minimum 4GB RAM recommended
- GPU support optional (will use CPU if GPU not available)

## üéØ Usage

1. **Start the application** using the command above
2. **Upload or capture a face photo** in the first column
3. **Upload a target image** in the second column
4. **Click "Swap Faces"** to process the images
5. **Download the result** using the download button

### Tips for Best Results

- Use clear, front-facing photos
- Ensure good lighting in both images
- Avoid extreme angles or partial face visibility
- Higher resolution images produce better results

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- First run will download the face swapping model (~530MB)
- Processing time depends on image size and system performance
- The application requires internet connection for initial model download
- Face detection may fail with obscured or angled faces

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Model download fails**
   - Check your internet connection
   - Try manually downloading the model from InsightFace repository

2. **Face not detected**
   - Ensure faces are clearly visible
   - Try different images with better lighting

3. **Performance issues**
   - Reduce image resolution
   - Close other applications to free up memory
